## Why do you need a Homelab?

Truth be told, you don't *really* need a homelab. After all, everything is on the cloud these days, right? Netflix is but a button away; your phone automatically backs up all of your data for you; and you can even compile the entire Linux kernel "through" your tiny Chromebook.

All is good and well until you realize that things are not as perfect as they initially seemed.

Well, it might be perfect. But it is not perfect *for you*. It is not perfect for you because you are not a "normal person" to whom tech is a means for an end. You don't go running to your ISP when "Internet is slow"; you double triple check your DNS config first.

A family member decides to view that advertisement emailed to them from the prince of Nigeria? No worries; all of your households data is securely and timely backed-up anyways.

And when your neighbors are all sitting bored because of a blackout, you enjoy your extra 15 minutes of gaming, then a Hollywood blockbuster on your legally obtained DVD, and finally 3 more hours of light browsing over a phone or tablet. After all, you did invest time and money into perfecting that whole-home UPS backup, configured with dynamic service availability based on remaining battery juice.

If that sounds like you, then you must also know the ever-lasting wisdom:

> The cloud is just someone else's computer

And you can either pay to use it, or pay to learn how to someday get paid to build it. You take the road less traveled by. And of course, whom are we kidding; it's so much fun!
